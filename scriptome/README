This tool is designed to read an SBML file downloaded from Reactome.org and
parse the stoichiometry data.  It will provide a list of the species in the
provided pathway and their starting quantities.  You can then run a simulation
of what the quantities of each reagent will be after running all of the 
reactions in that pathway.  Additionally, there is an option to write out the
resulting quantities to a node attribute file suitable for import into 
Cytoscape (http://cytoscape.org).  The attribute file is of the format:
    Species Name = Quantity

Environment variables:
PATHWAY_FILE    The filesystem path to the SBML file we'll be parsing
NODE_ATTR_FILE  The filesystem path where you'd like to save the Cytoscape 
                    Node Attribute file
DEFAULTS_FILE   An option file containing hardcoded starting values for 
                    specific species of the format:

                    species_#=0.0
   
                    Note that the species number in the DEFAULTS_FILE is not
                    the same as the Species Name from the Attribute File.  
                    Species number is a unique identifier.  Species name is not 
                    necessarily unique.
